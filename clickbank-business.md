When I first began in the world of affilate marketing one of the first sites I cam across was clickbank. If you don't already know, clickbank is an affiliate network. This is a ype of business where sellers can list products they need help selling and affiliates can sell those products for commissions. Clickbank, unlike amazon associates, is dedicated to selling digital products and services instead of physical products.

Clickbank is often one of the first websites new affiliate marketers try out and many find a vast amount of success with it. There are thousands of high quality products. Some of these products are training courses, some are ebooks, some are software packages, and some are services. At one point, clickbank was filled with scammy garbage products but clickbank has, over the years, cleaned up their service and today most of the products software are actually relatively high quality.

## What is a clickbank Business?

A lot of people who are just starting out, struggle with affiliate marketing. It takes time, it takes a lot of trial and error, and it takes money to run ads. Starting an affiliate marketing business is certainly not easy. This is where a clickbank business can come into play. A clickbank business is a type of business model build around the clickbank service. It is a business designed to help new affiliate marketers create websites or web stores. 

Clickbank businesses help new marketers begin in their journey of affiliate marketing by cutting out many of the costs and troubles that come with learning this industry. One such clickbank business of course is that of affiliate payday. This is a unique type of clickbank business. It grants members access to blogs that are filled with clickbank products. It helps all members promote their clickbank business through a cooperaive business model. 

The way this clickbnak business works is relative simple. Every member gets 2 cooperative rotator links. One that directly rotates clickbank products and another that rotates blog posts. When a member promotes their clickbank business rotator links, they earn credits each time someone opens one of those links. The more credits they earn, the more their own products are displayed to others. 

This means those just starting out as affiliate marketers, have a full clickbank business where everyone is helping everyone else promote that business. If one is newer to marketing and doesn't have a large budget or doesn't know where to begin, they can start small and still benefit from the promotions of other marketers. For example, someone just starting out, may promote their links on free marketing sites like classified ads, safelists, or traffic exchanges. Because everyone is working cooperatively their business will still receive traffic from higher quality sites like forums, social ads, and search engines even though thats not where they are personally promoting. In return other members of the clickbank business will receive hits from the sites they do promote on. 

In this respect, the more members that join and become part of the clickbank business, the more traffic everynoe else in the program will receive. This becomes a win win for everyone involved and means the early one joins and the longer they stay a member the more chances they will have to make sales and profits.
